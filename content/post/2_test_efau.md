# EARTH FIRST! action update

**No compromise!**

**number 4 June 1993 20p**



## The Debt Crisis

**10th May** Three banks in Leicester were the focus for protests about the High Street Banks’ involvement in the continuing 3rd World Debt Crisis. About 60 activists dressed as chickens, parrots, tomatoes, and various other animals and vegetables wandered into Lloyds, Barclays and Midland and chained themselves inside the banks. Others handed out leaflets, fixed banners and banged drums. All three banks were closed early and Lloyds was occupied until demands and questions faxed to head office were answered. Lloyd’s involvement in the destructive Grande Carajas project in Amazonia was made public for the first time, and information was obtained suggesting that Barclays involvement in 3rd World Debt is much larger than shareholders have been led to believe.

**Another action is planned July 9th in Nottingham, **workshops on 8th July. Contact **LEAF** for further details on **0533 621 2317**. For information on the debt crisis contact Lloyds and Midland Boycott, c/o Manchester University Students Union, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PR tel: 061 275 2930.


## SKYE BRIDGE ACTION CAMP

Despite a court interdict protestors managed to disrupt work on the 2nd June - the first of a series of days of action planned for the summer. People climbed around all over the place, up tower cranes, over excavators, along cables and on to work barges. Two inflatable dinghies blocked contractors' vessels. Contractors tried to ram the boats and even attacked a boat being used by the press. Eight activists were arrested, and placed on ridiculous bail conditions not to go within 5 miles of the construction site. There is a lot of local support for this action in Skye. A new camp has been set up and the next day of action is planned for the 30th June. Further information from Oxford EF! **Actions will continue all summer until this bridge is stopped!**



## CARMAGGEDON

The **15th May International Day of Traffic Action** was the biggest ever this year, demonstrating the growing demand for building climate alliances between countries of the north with those of the south. The day of action highlighted the inequality in CO2 emissions between north and south. Ten actions took place in Britain, focussing on local problems with a global overview. Actions took place in Birmingham, Bury St. Edmonds, Edinburgh, Leeds, London, Newcastle, Norwich, Oxford, Winchester and Worthing. Actions also took place in over 50 countries including Bangladesh, Sweden, Sierra Leone, Trinidad, Uganda....

## Twyford Rising

**1st-3rd May**  
A weekend of Beltane madness. Work stopped on three sites by 150 people. Many machines mysteriously break down in sympathy with the plight of the landscape.

**22nd May**  
Operation Greenfly! A hugely successful action with 200 protestors peacefully occupying the site of a temporary bailey bridge assembly, despite a huge police and Group 4 presence. When activists politely refused police requests to come down off the bridge they were arrested and dragged away one at a time. 52 were arrested in total and charged with public order offences. Massive media coverage! 

**High Court Injunction**  
On 26th May, Mrs Justice Ebsworth made orders for an "Interim Interlocutary Injunction" on 74 protestors. It forbids them to protest on or near the M3 destruction site. The temporary orders are designed to "safe-guard" the work sites against further "nuisance" until 21st July the first day of the three day hearing. Please come and support the defenders of the Down!

**The protests at Twyford have already cost Tarmac £1.75 million - a clear statement to construction firms not to take on environmentally destructive work.**

**Future actions:**

**16th June**  
A medicine man from the Lakota indigenous nation of North America wants to meet everyone fighting for our ancient spiritual heritage. He wants to perform rituals, perhaps in Oxleas Wood, to awaken the land and the warrior spirit in us all. Contact Twyford Down Alert for confirmation.

**3rd July**  
A massive action planned to get everyone on the injunction (and 3,000 others) to defy the legal system which fails to enforce its laws to protect the land yet punishes those who stand up to the planet wreckers. Stuff the injunction!

**Summer Camp**  
A week long Summer action camp one or two weeks after Glastonbury at a place to be confirmed.... Twyford Down Alert have moved - please note the new number.

**Contact Twyford Down Alert for further details: 0703 611561**



### European Summit

**21st - 22nd June**  
The European Summit will be held in Copenhagen and protests are planned to raise environmental issues in the minds of the Eurocrats and generally cause mayhem and chaos, non-violently and peacefully of course. What do these Euro MPs do? Previous European actions have disrupted press conferences and got on the telly. Maybe it will sink in to these braindead politicians that we have a problem. Details of actions planned and travel arrangements etc from Brixton EF! on 071 737 0100.
